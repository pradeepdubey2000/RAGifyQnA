# üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for PDF Question Answering

Welcome to the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System** project! This system empowers users to interact with PDF documents by uploading them and asking questions. The system intelligently retrieves relevant information and generates precise, contextually accurate responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### 1. Document Ingestion
- **PDF Loading**: Leverages `PyPDFium2Loader` for robust PDF processing.
- **Text Splitting**: Utilizes advanced methods to segment documents:
  - **Semantic Chunking**: Breaks text into meaningful segments, preserving context.
  - **Recursive Splitting**: Ensures chunks fit within token limits for optimal processing.

### 2. Embeddings and Vector Store
- **Embeddings Generation**: Converts text chunks into dense, semantic vectors using the `FastEmbedEmbeddings` model.
- **Vector Store**: Efficiently stores embeddings in a `Qdrant` vector store for quick retrieval during queries.

### 3. Reranking and Filtering
- **Reranking**: Applies the `FlashrankRerank` model to prioritize document chunks by relevance.
- **LLM Chain Filtering**: Optionally filters results further using a Large Language Model (LLM) for enhanced accuracy.

### 4. Question Answering (QA) Chain
- **Prompt Construction**: Crafts structured prompts with a chat template, guiding the LLM to produce concise, relevant answers.
- **Response Generation**: Generates markdown-formatted responses using either local (`ChatOllama`) or remote (`ChatGroq`) LLMs.

### 5. User Interaction
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an intuitive, web-based interface for seamless user interaction.
- **Conversation Management**: Maintains session history for continuous, context-aware conversations.

### 6. Session and Document Management
- **Session Handling**: Manages user sessions, preserving context across multiple queries.
- **Document Upload**: Supports multiple PDF uploads, processing, and storing documents for ongoing interaction.

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

1. **PDF Upload**: Users upload a PDF, which the system processes by splitting it into text chunks and embedding them into vectors.
2. **Question Submission**: Users submit a query; the system retrieves the most relevant chunks, reranks, and filters them.
3. **Answer Generation**: The system generates an answer based on the retrieved context and presents it to the user.
4. **Review and Interaction**: Users can review the answer with references to the source documents, ensuring transparency and trust.
